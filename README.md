## IHSS-Data-Project
I performed this project during my time as a Provider caregiver for Recipients in Los Angeles County. To put my analysis skills to work, I helped peform what I would call, Recipient Analysis. With the permission of the Recipient. I would help collect and organize their household budgetary data, housekeeping schedule data, meal plan data, shopping, in-door & outdoor activity data, and more, to better understand trends of behavior, interests and needs of each Recipient. The more time I spent with a Recipient, the more data I was able to accumulate and eventually was able to create a spreadsheet that showed a complete big picture of the Recipient's daily and monthly activity. As analyzed and updated the data, through data entry, I was able to create a Looker Studio dashboard that visualized all the collected data over time. I would share this data with the Recipient to show them how I can provide better service and more focused attention to their daily needs. 

### NOTE: The Looker Studio visual is a jpeg file because Google has very strict rules about how data is shared. You are able to share the dashboard publicly but the data will not show unless you share specific data with certain Stakeholders. 

#### Data Sharing: In order to protect the privacy of the Recipients. the data in the Looker Studio Dashboard(jpeg file) is mock data that displays use case.
